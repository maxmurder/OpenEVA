title: Artistic Concept and Style
---
In my post on design philosophy I somewhat discourage dvelopers from spending too much time creating concept artwork or narrative elements. A game's content development, especially on hobby or small team projects should only begin once a flexible framework of gameplay mechanics, pipeline tools and user interfaces
have been developed. However, having some concept art and exploring theme, style and narrative elements can be vitally importast to a game's early and ongoing development. Attractive art and narrative concepts are key to private, buisness, crowdsourced and venture capital investment in the traditional and indy games industry. Strong creative concepts are neccacary to build a player base, and maintain hype and interest. Finally developing concept material will allow us to visalize pipelines, design features and interfaces, explore and mature our models, and otherwise help develop the game and the tools needed to realize our vision. Now that we have a satillite's veiw of the design and mechanics of OpenEVA on paper, I feel we can take some time to explore thematic, stylistic and narrative possibilities and develop some concept artwork and other material.
