title: Resources and Game State
---
Along with Equipmpnt and Events, Resources will complete the core gameplay interactions the player has with OpenEVA. Resources are simpily some float or integer value that is tracked by the game that has some in-game utility or value. Specific Resources, thier utility and value will be defined by content creators using simple JSON. Currency, fuel, part invintories, electricity, cargo space, hunger and oxygen levels will be represented via Resources. Events may reqire, consume or reward Resources. Parts will require Resources to fabricate and may be broken down or recycled. Equipment may produce, consume and store resources. Using clever definitions content designers should be able to create complex Resource chains and economys as well as interesting mechanics and interactions.

A simple interface will allow the player to trade certian Resources, Parts and Equipment. Parts and Equipmpnt which store, produce or consume Resources will maintain a simple interface to inform the player of, an control the flow of Resources. Players will also have concise summary of thier Resource inventory, and prduction and consumption rates.

I want to capture some form of overall score. Conceptually the game will end

Resourses will be a foundatinal cornerstone of OpenEVA gameplay and content design. Most Equipmpnt and Events will involve Resources in some way.
