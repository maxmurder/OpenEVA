Now that we have a high level concept for OpenEVA layed out, we can begin to plan a development schedule, choose technologies, and identify risks. An intelligent plan and develeopment strategy is crucial to the success of any game, software, or engineering project. Laying out a roadmap of our project's features and development will allow us to define scope, set milestones and deadlines, and prevent feature creep or wated effort.
