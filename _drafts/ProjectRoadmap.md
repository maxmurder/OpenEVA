title: Project Roadmap
---
Now that we have a high level concept for OpenEVA laid out, we can begin to plan a development schedule, choose technologies, and identify risks. An intelligent plan and development strategy is crucial to the success of any game, software, or engineering project. Laying out a roadmap of our project's features and development will allow us to define scope, set milestones and deadlines, and prevent feature creep or wasted effort. Having a concise plan will give us reference for the future, allow others to collaborate and help us develop the pipelines, environments and technology we will use to realize our vision.

I would like to release the 1.0 version of OpenEVA in the spring or summer of 2020. Three years of core development will provide ample time to develop the core features of OpenEVA as well as provide time to generate the content required to
release a finished product. Continuing maintenance and development will continue beyond the release date and I plan to develop additional scenarios once the main game is complete. The final product should ship with fully developed features and a well developed main campaign scenario and high quality content. Comprehensive documentation material will be developed, explaining to players how to use the game and outlining to content creators the methods and syntax they will use to develop their own scenarios and extend the base game. Finally, we will need to provision and administer build, test and deployment automation, an official webpage, forum and wiki to facilitate distribution and community. Full stack game development has  complex facets, considerations and work to be done. Good planning and design will be essential for the development of OpenEVA to be possible.

##### Pre-Development and Research

I plan to spend the next several weeks researching the state-of-the-art of free software gamedev tools and software development practices. It is very easy for a developer working at a software development company, or in their own environment to allow their knowledge to stagnate. Long term development or maintenance projects tend to lock in to specific technology and techniques, while progress and technological innovation outside continues unabetted. A large part of my inspiration to develop OpenEVA is the desire to revise and refine my technical and creative techniques, process and knowledge. OpenEVA will give me a chance to explore and learn modern art, software and game development techniques. I intent to share my learning experience, readers can expect detailed analysis and exposition of my process, techniques and technologies as I plan, research and develop OpenEVA. 

Exiting new technology is constantly developed; Godot 3.0, which I have chosen to develop OpenEVA is currently in alpha release, and contains some powerful new features which will be crucial to OpenEVA's development. We will need to explore solutions for OpenEVA's game state database and interactions, user interface design, content pipelines and more. I would also like to experiment with artistic style transfer, AI and procedural content generation.

We will need to develop infrastructure to support the development, documentation and community of OpenEVA. Development environments and technology will need to be set up. Build, test and deployment automation systems need to be provisioned. The devblog, project website, official forums, community wiki and social media pages will need to be administered and maintained.

OpenEVA and any complete game or software development project requires a large amount of research, planning and infrastructure before core development can be effectively started. I plan for several weeks of pre-development and preliminary research and experimentation before the core development of OpenEVA will begin.
