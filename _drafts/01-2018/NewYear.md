title: Happy New Year!
---
It's a new year and I am very exited for it. 2017 was more or less productive for me and despite some setbacks I actually made more progress on OpenEVA than I had anticipated. I had planned for 2017 to be mostly planning and experimentation with the game and new engine, which has worked out well. I have a pretty good idea on the way forward for the project and am confident with the design so far. This year I plan on starting development in earnest, with all core features being completed by the year's end. This should allow for ample time to fully develop our features to the point of polish before moving to art and content generation. It will be some time before we have a playable game but stay tuned as 2018 should be an exiting year of game development!
