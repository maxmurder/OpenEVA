title: User Storytime Part II Developer Boogaloo
---
As developers we are also users of our software or game, with a vastly different story than an end user. It is important to consider the developer's story as they have needs that need to be supported by our product. We need to integrate workflows into the software, explore development environments, provision testing and deployment automation, and provide documentation, issue tracking and support. A good development pipeline is key to any traditional or open source game development.

OpenEVA will have several sets of developers which will form a sort of venn diagram of production: The core developers who write and maintain the source code; Content developers who create art, narrative and gameplay modules; And modders who develop extension libraries for the game.
