title: User Storytime

An important step when designing any game or software project is to identify users and use cases. We want to develop features and interfaces which appeal to end-users and allow them to use our product effectively. We must also provide infrastructure to distribute and support our product. Developers should develop a full set of use cases and user stories before they begin writing their software. A comprehensive user story will allow us to visualize the features and interfaces they will use, while serving as a thought experiment enabling further maturation of our design.

When considering use cases and user stories we must also include the developers, artists and maintainers who will create and support our game. As well, we should think about website, documentation, support and community site users. We will need to develop infrastructure to support a variety of use-cases, so it is valuable to analyze our design in an array of contexts.

For OpenEVA we can immediately identify several major use-cases. The first is player of the game, who will use the software features of the game itself, and require distribution, support and community infrastructure. Secondly, the content developers and modders who will produce and extend OpenEVA gameplay, narrative and artistic content; They will require pipeline and definition syntax as well as documentation, community and distribution facilities. Finally we have core developers who will write and maintain the software and supporting infrastructure itself; Development environments, technologies, workflows, standards and practices must be explored and defined. Many more meta and edge use cases exist around OpenEVA which will need to be analyzed throughout development.

##### The Player

The easiest place to start when formulating user stories is with the typical end-user. For OpenEVA, and most games this is the player using the complete, vanilla version of the game. Player's will be the main users of the game as well as the target audience for our features and content. Players will also require distribution, documentation, community and support infrastructure. The player experience is central to the success of any game. 

The typical user story for the player will start with them learning about the game through social media, journalism, advertisement and word of mouth. I intend to keep a fairly low key social media presence during OpenEVA's development. The main community interaction and promotion of the game during the game's early development will mostly revolve around the devblog and github project. Although I am fairly social media averse, I may set up pages and accounts for OpenEVA on various social media platforms as the game and community evolve. For now, OpenEVA's social media presence consists of the [/r/OpenEVA](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenEVA/) subreddit, which will suffice to promote the devblog during early development. I do not plan on expending resources on traditional advertising, I don't expect to profit financially from OpenEVA, however I will develop some promotional material for the press and use on various distribution and discovery platforms.
