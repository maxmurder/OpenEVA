title: Philosophy of Design
---
I bill myself as a software developer and programmer, I enjoy electrical engineering and mechanics as hobbies, I probably should have gone for an engineering degree, and one day I may. However, my training is in game art and design, which are two areas that usually neglected in my projects in favor of putting code to silicone. I generally scoff at high level design, I can't count the friends, family and acquaintances, when they learn I develop software and games, who have divulged to me their fourteen billion dollar game ideas; Which generally tend to be nothing more than high level story, theme, or even simple character concepts. Despite this, I have enough experience to see the value in a strong, concise technical design spec and solid development plan. So, with OpenEVA I intent to take a different approach to game development than I usually follow. Keeping a regular devblog, documenting my designs, techniques and process, and taking time to develop strong technical design spec before writing a single line of code.
